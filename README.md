### ESET 219 Krysis Robot Project at Texas A&M University, Fall 2019

The Krysis Robot will use three inductors on the front of a sensor board to detect it's location on a wire track. It will use a state machine to adjust the speed of its motors to keep it on the track to complete the circuit. The project requires a Basys3 board.
